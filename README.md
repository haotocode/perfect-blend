## Welcome ðŸ˜„!

    This project is a capstone project for my 12 weeks at BrainStation, a boot camp for web development.

1.  **About Perfect Blend**

    Perfect Blend is a project to help discover coffee lover's own taste. Through learning more about coffee, users will be recommended blends that match their own preferences. 

    Fear not! No more going to grocery stores and stare at packaging labels. You will like what you're recommended.

2. **Tech Stacks**

    Having leared React, I wanted to try something different by going above and beyond for this project.

    Front End:

    This project is built using GatsbyJS, a static site generator for React.

    I wanted to explore the possibility of creating a custom website with the ease of using headless CMS to create content. The blog section is linked with Netlify's headless CMS.

    Back End:

    I used mySQL server hosting data and pulled in with GraphQL.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start!

    1. Clone repo
    2. npm install for dependencies
    3. command line: gatsby develop
    4. Site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
