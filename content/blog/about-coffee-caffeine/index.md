All cups of coffee contain the same amount of caffeine right? 

Not as straightforward as you think. Caffeine content depends on the way the beans are roasted in combination of the way you make coffee.  For example, drip filtered coffee has more caffeine than a French press. Who knew. While known, espresso shots have more caffeine per ounce, you end up getting more caffeine from a cup of brewed coffee simply of the quantity of consumption.
