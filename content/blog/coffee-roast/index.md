From green, soft, tasteless to dark, flavourful, crunchy beans we know as coffee, the roasting process determines the final product that end up in our cup.  The most common way coffee roasts are describe is a range from light to dark (or extra dark). As coffee beans absorb heat in the roasting process, their colour becomes darker. Although not always accurate to judge coffee beans on their colour to determine roast, typically, in combination with a standard roasting temperature which yields a particular shade of brown, color is a convenient way to categorize roasting levels.

One important fact to note here is that roast names are not standardized, for example, on the darker spectrum of roasts, French, Italian, Spanish roasts are terms known in the market of potential preferences exhibited by that region in the world.
